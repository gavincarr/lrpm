lrpm is a simple logging wrapper for rpm, intended to allow rpm updates
to be captured and logged in the same way as updates via yum.

lrpm just passes all arguments straight through to rpm itself. If rpm
returns success, and the transaction is not a query, lrpm logs the
details to the /var/log/yum.log log file, in the standard yum format.
